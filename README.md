# advent_of_code

Merry Meetup and a Happy New Year!

For our last meetup of the year we will have a look at the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

There is a new challenge posted each day between 1st - 25th December. These challenges are very accessible to begin with and then they get a bit harder each day. In this meetup we will first look at how to enter the Advent of Code and then how to submit a solution to a challenge. For the remainder of the meetup we will work through the 2017 Advent of Code challenges, before hopefully leaving you full of festive cheer and inspired to have a go at this year's upcoming Advent of Code.

We will host here the introduction solutions we will have a go at for 2017 in the meetup, and then during 2018 we will try to post our solutions for 2018 daily.
